## The Rules

To maximize results, **Brogram** follows these three golden rules:

### 1. **Rest Matters**
Take rest days as needed to allow your muscles to recover and grow stronger.

### 2. **Master Your Reps**
Perform every rep using the **2-2-2 tempo**:
   - 2 seconds eccentric (lowering phase)
   - 2 seconds pause
   - 2 seconds concentric (lifting phase)

This ensures control, precision, and maximum muscle engagement.

### 3. **Smart Weight Selection**
Use weights that challenge you while maintaining proper form:
   - **Set 1:** 75% of working weight
   - **Set 2:** 85% of working weight
   - **Sets 3 & 4:** 100% of working weight

## The Training Plan

Brogram's workouts are structured around a **Push â†’ Pull â†’ Legs** rotation. Each day targets specific muscle groups for optimal balance and strength:

- **Push Days:** Focus on chest, shoulders, and triceps.
- **Pull Days:** Target back, biceps, and rear delts.
- **Leg Days:** Build quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves.
